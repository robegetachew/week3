# AlphaCare Insurance Solutions: Risk and Predictive Analytics Project

## Executive Summary

AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) is focused on advancing risk and predictive analytics for car insurance within South Africa. As a Marketing Analytics Engineer, your role involves analyzing historical insurance claim data to optimize marketing strategies, identify "low-risk" targets for premium adjustments, and attract new clients.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to enhance risk and predictive analytics for car insurance at ACIS. By analyzing historical insurance claim data, we aim to refine marketing strategies and identify low-risk clients who may benefit from reduced premiums.

## Motivation

This project is designed to develop and refine skills in Data Engineering (DE), Predictive Analytics (PA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE). It provides a realistic simulation of financial analytics challenges, emphasizing the application of hypothesis testing and predictive modeling in the insurance industry.

## Problem Statement

ACIS seeks to improve its marketing effectiveness and client acquisition strategies through detailed analysis of historical insurance claim data. The goal is to adjust premiums for low-risk clients and gain insights into risk factors across various demographics and geographic locations.

## Objectives

1. **Understand Insurance Terminologies**:
   - Build a foundational understanding of insurance terms.

2. **Conduct A/B Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Test hypotheses to assess risk differences and margin impacts across demographics and geographic locations.

3. **Develop Predictive Models**:
   - Fit linear regression models and create machine learning models to predict total claims and optimal premium values based on various features.

4. **Report Findings**:
   - Document methodologies, findings, and recommendations to help ACIS tailor insurance products more effectively.

## Data

The dataset covers historical insurance claim data from February 2014 to August 2015.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Git and GitHub Setup

- **Create a GitHub Repository**:
  - Initialize a new repository and create a comprehensive README.
  
- **Version Control**:
  - Implement Git for version control and set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Statistics**:
  - Perform EDA to understand the data, identify trends, and detect outliers.
  - Regularly commit changes and document the analysis process.

### Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)

- **Install and Configure DVC**:
  - Install DVC and configure it for managing and versioning data.

- **Data Tracking**:
  - Use DVC to track and manage dataset versions.

**DVC Setup Instructions**:

1. Initialize DVC:

  ```bash
  dvc init
  ```
  
2. Configure Remote Storage:

```bash
dvc remote add -d localremote "path/to/your/local-storage/"  #"C:/Users/getac/Documents/10 Academy/week 3/KAIMW3DVC"
```

3. Add Data to DVC:

```bash
dvc add data/MachineLearningRating_v3.txt
```

4. Commit DVC Changes:

```bash
git add .dvc/config .dvc/cache data/.gitignore
git commit -m "Add DVC configuration and data"
```

### Task 3: A/B Hypothesis Testing

- **Test Hypotheses**:
  - There are no risk differences across provinces
  - There are no risk differences between zip codes
  - There are no significant margin (profit) difference between zip codes 
  - There are not significant risk difference between Women and Men

- **Data Segmentation and Analysis**:
  - Design and implement A/B tests, segment data, and analyze results.

### Task 4: Statistical Modeling

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Handle missing data, perform feature engineering, and encode categorical variables.

- **Model Building**:
  - Implement Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost).

- **Model Evaluation and Interpretability**:
  - Evaluate models using metrics such as accuracy and precision

- **Feature Importance Analysis**:
  - Analyze which features are most influential in predicting retention.

- Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret the model's predictions and understand how individual features influence the outcomes.

- Report comparison between each model performance.
  
## Learning Outcomes

- Develop expertise in managing and analyzing complex datasets.
- Enhance skills in hypothesis testing, predictive modeling, and data version control.
- Improve Python coding capabilities and understanding of EDA and machine learning pipelines.

## Contribution

- Actively engage with the tasks and contribute regularly.
- Share insights and progress through GitHub commits and documentation.

## Conclusion

The AlphaCare Insurance Solutions project aims to transform how insurance risk and client acquisition are approached by leveraging advanced data analytics and predictive modeling. Through rigorous analysis of historical insurance claims, hypothesis testing, and the development of robust predictive models, we will provide actionable insights that can significantly enhance ACIS's marketing strategies and client targeting. This project not only improves your skills in data engineering, predictive analytics, and machine learning but also contributes to meaningful advancements in the insurance industry by optimizing marketing efforts and identifying low-risk clients for premium adjustments. The successful completion of this project will pave the way for more data-driven decision-making and strategic planning in car insurance.
